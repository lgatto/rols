<p>The <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/">Ontology Lookup Service</a> (OLS) [<a href="http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-7-97">1</a>, <a href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/36/suppl_2/W372">2</a>] is originally spin-off of the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/">PRoteomics IDEntifications</a> database (PRIDE) service, located at the EBI, and is now developed and maintained by the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/spot-team">Samples, Phenotypes and Ontologies</a> team at EMBL-EBI.</p>

<div id="the-package" class="section level2">

<a href="#the-package" class="anchor"></a>The package</h2>
<p>The OLS provides a REST interface to hundreds of ontologies from a single location with a unified output format. The <em><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/rols">rols</a></em> package make this possible from within R. Do do so, it relies on the <em><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=httr">httr</a></em> package to query the REST interface, and access and retrieve data.</p>
<p>There are 198 ontologies available in the OLS, listed in the table below. Their name is to be use to defined which ontology to query.</p>

<p>A researcher might be interested in the trans-Golgi network. Searching the OLS is assured by the <code>OlsSearch</code> and <code>olsSearch</code> classes/functions. The first step is to defined the search query with <code>OlsSearch</code>, as shown below. This creates an search object of class <code>OlsSearch</code> that stores the query and its parameters. In records the number of requested results (default is 20) and the total number of possible results (there are 12492 results across all ontologies, in this case). At this stage, the results have not yet been downloaded, as shown by the 0 responses.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/OlsSearch-class.html">OlsSearch</a></span>(<span class="dt">q =</span> <span class="st">"trans-golgi network"</span>)</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## Object of class 'OlsSearch':
##   query: trans-golgi network 
##   requested: 20 (out of 12492)
##   response(s): 0</code></pre>
<p>12492 results are probably too many to be relevant. Below we show how to perform an exact search by setting <code>exact = TRUE</code>, and limiting the search the the GO ontology by specifying <code>ontology = "GO"</code>, or doing both.</p>

<p>Let’s proceed with the exact search and retrieve the results. Even if we request the default 20 results, only the 7 relevant result will be retrieved. The <code>olsSearch</code> function updates the previously created object (called <code>qry</code> below) by adding the results to it.</p>

<p>In this case, we can see that we actually retrieve the same term used across different ontologies. In such cases, it might be useful to keep only non-redundant term instances. Here, this would have been equivalent to searching the ncit, omit, go ontology</p>

<p>It is possible to observe different results with <em><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/rols">rols</a></em> and <em><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/GO.db">GO.db</a></em>, as a result of the different ways they access the data. <em><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/rols">rols</a></em> or <em><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/biomaRt">biomaRt</a></em> perform direct online queries, while <em><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/GO.db">GO.db</a></em> and other annotation packages use database snapshot that are updated every release.</p>
<p>Both approaches have advantages. While online queries allow to obtain the latest up-to-date information, such approaches rely on network availability and quality. If reproducibility is a major issue, the version of the database to be queried can easily be controlled with off-line approaches. In the case of <em><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/rols">rols</a></em>, although the load date of a specific ontology can be queried with <code>olsVersion</code>, it is not possible to query a specific version of an ontology.</p>
